HTML/CSS for the previous iterations of Hope Empowerment Foundation- Uganda's website

Before I switched HEFO-U's website to Webflow, I coded some basic pages for the sake of rapid prototyping. While hosted on Tumblr, I coded everything from scratch.
The 2 pieces of code in this repository are copied directly from those Tumblr pages.

I initially messed around with the code in Adobe XD but added in other work (eg: more CSS, the actual page content, etc) while coding in Tumblr and using live preview.

Right now, the "REDIRECT" file shows the code currently in use for the old Tumblr URL (in case any users are directed to the website's old link).
The "OUTDATED" file features the earliest version of the website, including some obtrusive Javascript functions.

The Javascript was one of the reasons I later decided to switch to Webflow, since the website would have to work on low-speed internet and devices with low capabilities.

Despite the weak UI and visual design of the outdated site, it was integral in discussions with HEFO-U leaders as we iterated on more general design ideas for their website.

The final (live) website can be viewed at https://hopeempowermentfoundation.webflow.io
